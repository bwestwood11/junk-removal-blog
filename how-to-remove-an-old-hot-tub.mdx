## **Assessing the Situation**

Before you start dismantling your hot tub, you need to assess the situation and plan accordingly. Here's what you should do:

1. Safety First
Ensure you have the necessary safety gear such as gloves and safety glasses. Also, enlist the help of a friend or two; this is not a one-person job.

2. Check for Permits
Some areas may require permits for hot tub removal, so check with your local authorities to avoid any legal issues.

3. Disconnect Utilities
Turn off the power, water, and gas supply to the hot tub to prevent accidents during removal.

## **Draining the Hot Tub**

The next step is to drain the hot tub completely.

4. Locate the Drain Valve
Locate the drain valve usually located near the bottom of the hot tub.

5. Attach a hose
Attach a garden hose to the drain valve and place the other end in a suitable drainage area, ensuring proper water disposal.

6. Open the Valve
Open the drain valve and allow the water to flow out. This might take a while, so be patient.

## **Dismantling the Hot Tub**

Now comes the challenging part - dismantling the hot tub itself.

7. Remove the Panels
Start by removing the side panels of the hot tub. They are usually held in place with screws.
