## **Before You Get Rid of Your Old Couch**

Before you get rid of your old couch, you should consider the following:

1. Is it still in good condition? If so, you may want to donate it or sell it on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace or OfferUp for a few hundred dollars. These are great places to sell your old furniture. You can also donate it to a local charity or thrift store.

2. Is it broken? If so, you may want to consider recycling it. You can find a local recycling center near you by searching online for "recycling center near me" or "recycling center in [your city]."

3. Do you just need to get rid of it and its not in good condition? If so, you can call a junk removal company to come and pick it up for you.

## **How to Get Rid of an Old Couch**

If you have decided that you want to get rid of your old couch, here are some steps to take:

1. Remove all cushions from the couch and place them in a trash bag or box. You can also use this time to vacuum the couch and remove any crumbs or debris that may be on it.

2. Be wary of your doorway or any other objects that may be in your way. Some couches will require you to disassemble the legs so you can fit through the doorway. If you are unsure, you can always call a junk removal company to come and pick it up for you.

3. If you are going to be disposing of the couch yourself, you will need to find a local landfill or dump site near you. You can find one by searching online for "landfill near me" or "dump site in [your city]." Be aware that private landfills will charge you to dispose of your couch. However, usually the county owned dumps will not charge you to dispose of your couch.

4. Loading the couch into your truck or trailer is pretty self-explanatory. Just make sure that you have enough room for it and that it is secure so it doesn't fall out while driving. We recommend using straps and bungee cords to secure it properly
