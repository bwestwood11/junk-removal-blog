**The Importance of Proper Disposal** 

Proper disposal of e-waste is crucial to mitigate the environmental impact and protect human health. It also ensures the recovery of valuable resources like precious metals and reduces the energy required for manufacturing new devices.

**Understanding E-Waste Categories**

E-waste can be categorized into two groups:

## **Electronics That Can Be Reused or Recyclyed**

Many electronic items can be refurbished or recycled, extending their lifespan and reducing waste. These items include smartphones, laptops, and tablets that are in good condition but are no longer needed.

## **Electronics That Require Special Disposal**

Certain electronic devices, such as old cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitors and tube televisions, contain hazardous components like leaded glass and should not be disposed of with regular trash.
